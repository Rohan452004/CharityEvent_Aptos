# Charity Event Token Rewards Contract

## Introduction
This is a Move smart contract that implements a simple charity event reward system. It allows event organizers to create new charity events, maintain a reward pool, and distribute rewards to participants.

## Vision
The goal of this project is to provide a decentralized and transparent platform for charity organizations to manage token-based reward programs for their events. By leveraging the Aptos blockchain, we aim to ensure the integrity and traceability of the reward distribution process, fostering trust and engagement between organizers and participants.

## Future Goals
- Add support for multiple reward tiers or bonuses based on participation levels.
- Implement event expiration and automatic reward distribution.
- Allow participants to claim their own rewards.
- Add event history and leaderboard functionality.
